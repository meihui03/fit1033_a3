# Prison Break Diorama – 3D Scene in Unity

## Project Overview

This project is a 3D diorama created in Unity that visually represents a dramatic escape scene from a prison torture room. Rather than an interactive game, the scene is designed as a **static (or lightly animated) storytelling environment** that captures a key moment in the narrative — the prisoner's escape.

## Story Concept

A prisoner, held captive in a torture chamber, finds a way to escape:

- Using **pliers** to break free from the handcuffs.
- Using a **knife** to open the grate covering a hidden underground drain.

Initially, the escape route was intended to be through a **window**, but to enhance the story and realism, it was changed to a **drain beneath the floor**, creating a more grounded and gritty atmosphere.

The final scene captures the exact moment of escape, emphasizing environmental storytelling through object placement, lighting, and mood.

## Key Elements of the Diorama

- **Torture Room**: Dimly lit, worn-down room with bloodstains, shackles, and aging concrete textures.
- **Handcuffs**: Positioned on the floor or hanging open, hinting at recent escape.
- **Pliers & Knife**: Placed strategically to tell the story of how the prisoner freed themselves.
- **Drain Exit**: A partially open grate with signs of movement or disturbed floor tiles.
- **Lighting**: Cinematic spotlighting and shadows to emphasize key objects and create a moody, intense vibe.

## Tools Used

- **Unity** – scene assembly, lighting, and camera setup
- **Maya** – for modeling custom assets
- **Substance Painter** – for textures and materials
